With Migrate you will now be able to set up a default migration configuration, choose and assign workspaces for migration, preview the migration before executing the data transfer, and if needed, even retry failed workspace migrations easily from the same user interface. Migrations are easy to track and you can configure email notifications to alert the proper resources in your organization of migration status. (RelativityOne Osier Update 1)</td>

Viewer extensions may not be available in the un-synced standalone viewer upon first release, but they'll be added as soon as those extensions are able to enable those viewer extensions in the un-synced standalone viewer configuration. An example of a viewer extension that is not yet available in the un-synced standalone viewer is Email Thread Visualization (ETV).
Finally, the document actions dropdown menu in the 'un-synced' standalone viewer configuration does not yet have the same options as the other viewer configurations. Upon initial release, only the 'download native' option is available, but the remaining document actions will be added shortly thereafter. (RelativityOne Osier Update 1)</td>

Still update path method, does the path update (and file name update) in case of linked files always to file guide name. (that's why if original linked file was not guide named, it will be moved and renamed). (renaming linked files in case of changing them to repository files which mean copy them into repository is desired behavior because e.g. there can be already a file in repository with exactly same name, and the it would be overwritten or skipped, or cause error) There is also a mismatch in call to methods, so ARM creates batches not including processing files.

It was originally added to allow concurrent application installs within a single Application Installation Manager agent. We were hoping for less contention in the database by retrieving more workspaces per query and a speed improvement by running the installs concurrently. Since then we were able to reduce blocking in the query significantly, and we have found that multiple threads in an agent are no better than simply adding more agents. There was no longer a need for this capability. Without this setting, the recommended way for a Relativity administrator to speed up application installs is to add more Application Installation Manager agents. (Foxglove Early Access)</td>
