With Migrate you will now be able to set up a default migration configuration, choose and assign workspaces for migration, preview the migration before executing the data transfer, and if needed, even retry failed workspace migrations easily from the same user interface. Migrations are easy to track and you can configure email notifications to alert the proper resources in your organization of migration status. (RelativityOne Osier Update 1)",

An example of a viewer extension that is not yet available in the un-synced standalone viewer is Email Thread Visualization (ETV).\nFinally, the document actions dropdown menu in the 'un-synced' standalone viewer configuration does not yet have the same options as the other viewer configurations.

(Clients should uninstall it from workspaces even if they are not upgrading. It does not need to be in workspaces.) How to: 1. Log into the instance front end as a System Admin user. 2. Change the Instance setting \"DeveloperMode\" in section \"Relativity.Core\" to True 3. Go to the Application Library tab and click on \"Relativity.Telemetry\", this will show you a list of workspaces the app is installed in. 4. For every workspace the app is in: * Go to the workspace's \"Relativity Application\" tab * Click the Relativity.Telemetry application * Unlock the application via the button. * Uninstall the application via the button. * Verify the uninstall via the button. * Uninstall the application via the button 5. After the app has been uninstalled from every workspace, go back and change the Instance setting \"DeveloperMode\" in section \"Relativity.Core\" to False (Goatsbeard Early Access Update)",
